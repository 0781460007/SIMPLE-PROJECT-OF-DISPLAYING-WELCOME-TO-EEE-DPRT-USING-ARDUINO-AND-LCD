A liquid crystal display, or LCD, is a video display that utilizes the light modulating properties of liquid crystals to display pictures or text on a screen, to replace traditional cathode ray tubes  (CRT) as a more effective option. Since their invention in 1964, LCD screens have grown to be used in a very wide variety of applications, including computer monitors, televisions, and instrument panels as the management of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment recycling (WEEE). One way to utilize an LCD is with an Arduino microcontroller. By wiring an Arduino microcontroller to the pins of an LCD display it is possible to program the microcontroller to display a desired text string or image on the screen.
